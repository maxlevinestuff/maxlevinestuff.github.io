So, for example, there are two responses below; option 1 will be visible by default, but you will only be able to see option 2 if addKeyPossibility("option 2") has succesfully been called in javascript. You can do so in the javascript console.

And here is a test of a span: <span>this is inside a span</span>

<option1
)I went into javascript, enabled option 2, and selected it, because I'm cool%option 2$option 2
<option2

>option1
