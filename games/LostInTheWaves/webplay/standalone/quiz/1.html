<h2>Consciousness Transfer Protocol</h2>

<p>Project developed by Abernathy under PRW subset following contingency that the entropy curve surpasses the technological singularity curve. Follow the instructions carefully to transmit brainwaves and rebuild your consciousness in a digital medium. The core loop of consciousness (not including world knowledge) is a very simple knowledge of the self and can be extracted. To conserve energy in this unideal contingency, your consciousness will be simulated slowly, but your perception should theoretically remain the same. In the last step you will go to sleep and your soul will be on our server in Stasis.</p>
