<h2>The Mysterious Floating Islands</h2>

<p>Due to entropy, and because the earth computer is operating slowly and thus is very far into the future, the universe is filled with space debris/pockets of energy.</p>

<p>Also, due to another, mysterious phenomenon, complexity that occurs near lifeforms has become very commonly strewn about the universe. It’s as if the universe’s eye had always been focused on us.</p>
