var poemText = `Parasurama was the sixteenth avatar descended from Lord Vishnu. 
His purpose was to rid the earth of the evil Kshatriya kings who
strayed from the path of Dharma.  The story of Parasurama goes
that a Kshatriya king named “Karttaviryarjuna,” was hunting in the woods when he
stumbled across Parasurama’s house when Parasurama
wasn’t home.  However, Parasurama’s father was home
 and, as would be expected from a king’s subject, 
 supplied him with food and shelter.  Karttaviryarjuna 
 then saw Kamadhenu, the fabulous cow that grants all 
 wishes.  Karttaviryarjuna stole the cow because he 
 wanted her to himself.  When Parasurama came home 
 to find out about this, he pursued the king and 
 killed him.  Karttaviryarjuna’s son was told of his 
 father’s death and took revenge by killing Parasurama’s 
 father (Jamadagni).  Parasurama was angered by this and 
 promised to kill all Kshatriyan kings.  He kept his 
 promise and killed the kings not once but twenty-one 
 times.  Parasurama’s power is his axe called Parasu, 
 which he uses to destroy miscreants like the Kshatriya kings.`
