var poemText = `I like the sunlight
on my acne face and in my heart

bleach your brain
on the bleachers, on the activity bus, on the hiking trail
say nothing for hours for days for years
just sitting there thinkin’ of a big ‘ol oak tree
reliving favorite moments
think writing manifestos
a culture developing

guarded and shaped on all sides by monsters and invisible walls
delusional fears
invisible in the physical, but solid in the metaphysical

leave the path and the monsters will dissolve
climb the hill of rising action into the unknown
and discover the true nature of the world
(if you get tired of this conversation, you can just say bye)
unfortunately, you can’t leave on purpose
you must wait for a call—

a pure expression of my subconscious
and a syntactical story I wrote about <a href="../2wax/wax.html">wax fruit</a> predicted it all

the summer I
climbed a mountain
descended a canyon
and swam in the ocean
friends and a light that never goes out
present with the moment
engaged with the world

when I came home my house was small
and empty
filled with strange abstract shapes
culture shock between logic and emotion
the abstract and concrete
doing what you want versus doing what you have to do

idleness and pointless thinking blurs little ideas into big ones
like love being a pat on the shoulder

having a memory is only recalling the last time you recalled it
memories of thoughts are even less reliable
slight generalizations are useful, large are empty
cold, dead and I am trapped with them
don’t follow your heart

everyone inert
I am fiery radiant
righteous outrage
out of my shell
Freudian slips the devil:
I make up phrases and they think about them
a magnet exerts force when moving and linearly independent
all their eyes blue
everything disgusts me
when something isn’t moving, it is dead, part of the wasteland of the world
I drink from the water fountain
I am amazing

Phaethon brought his chariot high
Higher than lightning
So he was struck down
Not by the clouds
But from himself, a ray
Was the end of Phaethon’s day

Lack of Empathy due to selfishness
due to the false belief that Paradise exists
and therefore you cannot enjoy every moment
The resulting rigidization of human behavior is broken by a hero
who falls into another world
and through the analogy between two worlds—

I can feel my mind is dissolving
your only weakness is yourself
respect, confidence, weakness, dominance, attack, defend
idleness blurring your mind specific to unpleasant general
making a mess of your mind

FATAL ERROR
The Fall

yesterday I knew what everyone was thinking
now I know that this is shrinking
without the light of seeing through their eyes
locked off and inactivated, unsaturated raisin
body locking into a questionable position

daydreaming of walking a highway away from this place
I slam head on desk, eyes red
I haven’t slept in weeks
and again—

they aren’t windows to the soul
they are meat jelly
when they are still enough, you can see
gelatinous meat

Winter
spacey
everything spacious already in sepia
the mean and echoing air 
None of what they’re saying is true
Putting shit in my mouth
I’m not that lazy
Why are people so mean
I don’t deserve this
I didn’t do anything wrong
I was so happy for you
I love you
Hurt the best one
They don’t believe what they say you do
Has nobody to be mean to
Didn’t do anything wrong
Stop
I see them
They’re here
They don’t say anything
They don’t say
They don’t say
They’re insane
They’re insane!
I’m a good person
He was always the one
He was always alone
attacked by everyone
undeserved oppression
I can’t see anything clearly
Winter
Scatterbrain when those things are accepted on the surface to be true
It’s the winter
huddled like penguins
It projects everyone’s hatred outward, and I without a group
a cog is useless if it’s not part of a whole
against a wall of screaming flesh
everyone is the same person
in a series of rooms they are talking and judging you
People who attack on purpose are wrong
you’re not worthless, they just want you to think that
go with it, but be unaffected
It’s the winter
(the curse of subjective reality is that evidence morphs to match the hypothesis)
Enjoy the winter while it lasts, fools!

spirit crushed and into the machinery
the left brain concerned with small things
symbol shunting
right brain with big ideas
they don’t have to be in the same head

the psychology class was building
a brain out of Arduinos in the library
no big deal, but people kept talking about it
that’s not a computer said the librarian
it’s a brain

in the hospital they put freaks in my head
it all occurred to me in one mortifying moment
plastered all over the wall for me
and the nothingness that it is going to be
a cold mass in a grave
which is not the fate of all minds
jealousy for those who can transfer

my brain
out the window a desolate gravel roof
and an assortment of pipes and boxes
but the fan now broken renders the vent system useless
only ignorance had kept them going

the cross-hatches shading borders the darkest corners of our minds
shadows
he predicted a robotic claw holding my pen
the poet who was a pirate

in the dream book I found the hero with a thousand faces
and in the dream I found her in a garden of hedges
she whose happiness is inverse of mine
sine and cosine
I write two poems about winter
one is nice
the other is mean
they both mean the same thing

I am on my knees, take me from this place
and they stare with blood pouring out
not the red kind
from the crevices, flowing down the skin

the module transported us down, down
his cologne, the way he moved his neck like a goat, his earrings
you’re in charge now
I didn’t know how to navigate this maze
to reach that machine, a male womb, a second birth
the metallic digital tones of beeping and booping mocked the idea

once while measuring my pulse
she kicked my foot
sorry she squeaked
my heartbeat leaped in excitement
and then leaped again in fear
as my pulse was measured wrong

he walked circles around a table
he had an overgrown beard
soft moaning noises
that’s what he likes to do they said
he’s actually very intelligent they said
but how would any outsider know?
complexity could be the only metric
and he was me, to some degree
I watched him walking around that table on Thursdays
A circle is the most perfect of shapes
and it can be many sizes

I drew a bundle of neurons in the dark without input
hands shaking
I went over it again with colored pencils, then pastels
physical pain
It was twisted red in perpetuity, cathexis
Building box loom after box loom
or something after something
But surrounded by a network of blue
A black chasm separating them

connecting two separate neural networks:
intricate and nontrivial
takes years of careful work

I considered these imaginary neurons
splaying my fingers
looking at them with fear
and ironically pressing myself into the corner
into the yellow wallpaper of that room

drip drip creep creep
goes the sink

darkness separating me from any other soul
an infinite chasm

a locked door
a window to look inside
nothing inside
just a blank white box

my hands shake as I dry myself
the snack that smiles back
pop culture!

I cant stop moving
squirming
running my hands along the walls
touching everything
I didn’t know it was akathisia
I thought it was agony

discovering illogic
no longer blind to
a new way of thinking, of hearing
metaphors, synonyms
try each combination, quickly
attunement to this language most are born with
they hear it instantly and laugh
but never cross the two languages
they’ll call you crazy
even though they are in fact the crazy ones

rhyming is cool
alliteration is not

at night they turn up the river’s current
make it flow into my ears and out my mouth
like a salmon
until my voice breaks
until I vomit
it’s not fair
nobody makes faces like that in real life
we do rounds

in the dark
a girl comes into the room
stands staring through her glasses

start on the bottom rung
Ladders on top of two cars
find where the lines intersect
out there it’s cold

deprived of stimulus so that the brain begins to
learn from static
make meaningless connections
a neural tangle, a neural jungle
a type of malignant tumor
containing bizarre and purposeless fantasies, daydreams, hallucinations
just randomly connected neurons
the discomfort manifests physically in bulging eyes

outside my window way up high
I can see my high school from here
and a crane nearby
showing me how long this intervention was developed
three to four years
to save me from this tumor
a branching script, to contain me in, is not too complicated
a hundred headphones, monitors, somewhere in these walls
the world blanketed white, waiting for me now
the traffic light outside the window is always green: go
NOW
This is your final chance
Reach for the light that never goes out
Or die soon

In this facility
Hidden sensors watch me
Hidden speakers blast sounds at me
Lasers control my movements
Rewritten books and movies
and only the world’s best selected actors are around me
Choreographed
every word they say
every intonation
suggests an otherworldly genius
I am surrounded by perfect aliens
State of the art
It must have cost billions

everyone is here
they even brought myself as a young kid
when I was young I was annoying
I could control the weather with a black rock
make it rain and make it sunny

at night they turn up the river’s current
I try to balance on a bed seemingly three feet wide
precarious
a growl comes from beneath it
the river flows into my ears and out my mouth
until my voice can reach out on its own

until my vocal cords are fried
every day is a new way to be stupid

output nonsense at anyone who will listen
scared of being alone
and alone with these thoughts
maybe they have a technology that connects us
our minds to merge
to draw in three dimensions
who will save me
bring me back to the present

they are all are so much smarter
double meaning and ambiguous
the full extent of which
I don’t understand until hours later
decades later

I only live half my life
and I liked or didn’t like that book
y’know just because of the title
I read in a while
it’s about
I have good taste
and I coulda’ helped the kid if I knew ‘m better
moved me like ten times laughter
terrified of turtles
how’s it going?
good god give you a treat
if you make up your mind
and less spinning, more winning
trippy eight weeks
we do rounds said the face
never mind, never mind
I got helled up
I kept a list: some are its fine fungi terror joking upsetting anyway ketchup amazing know looser subculture alphabet crayons pastels understands ‘merica!
need a break?
why not think about a word in the dark?
a strange aloof man whispered as he passed me, “a facet.”

falling into a black hole
what will happen to your soul?
what will you be able to say?
how much do you now, null, weigh?
what this doesn’t mean
is a blank of color in-between

a black void
a spotlight shining on
a gang of monsters
playing in my head
my favorite memory on repeat

and it all came crashing down on me
in a single, terrifying moment
as I lay there, feeling forces and sounds 
a cosmic horror
from the wall to my left
in the room with the yellow wallpaper

All these years later
a nightmare here and there
about a freak lying in an empty room
wrapped in their own loose skin
a library of sadness deep underground
pale creatures in among the bookshelves
straining my eyes
a facility of handicapped people kept lined up in rows, their brains splayed vertically in boxes
being trapped in a pit
dreams of escaping

as I fall asleep I can feel
the texture and surface of a strange, mental object from my childhood, the nerves in my brain feel it rubbing into my mind
a sphere of flowing water
my forehead falling into
feels staticy
in a room overlooking the river
pontoon boats
and hear a voice repeating endlessly, that I can only tap into at the brink of sleep
what is it? sounds like pure syntax
if you listen a few seconds
or it could be the otherworldly truths
I’m capable of

but it’s not as urgent now
because the sunlight fills my heart with warmth
I like the sunlight

Anyway, thank you for listening
bye
