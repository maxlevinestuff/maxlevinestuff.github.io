<p>You decide you've had enough. If you unplug the juice harvesting equipment from all the globes, you'll run out of juice in just a few hours.</p>

<p>So you redirect the sad syrup so that it runs into a ghostly chasm near your house. And one by one, you retrieve the globes from their harvesting contraptions, set them on the ground, and let them roll. The white ground is perfectly smooth, but not completely level, so your globes are set to roll for eternity down an endless plane, forever out of reach of anyone.</p>

<p>How do you choose to spend your final moments?</p>
