			There is only enough juice left to last for today.</p>
			<p>But if you want to stay around, you still have a chance. Today you'll have to work extra hard at the farm, and if you do, you'll be able to get your quota up and potentially last for hundreds of more years.</p>
			<p>Or not: you could just let go, and walk around and say one last goodbye.</p>
