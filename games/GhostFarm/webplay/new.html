<p>You've lived here for so long, but of course everything fades into greyness and nothingness in this land. Still, you've managed to build a few memories here on your ghost farm, mostly nostalgic ones, and a few sad. It seems fitting to end here. You take a walk around and admire the strange, bleak, and retrospective environment that you've lived in. It hasn't been all that exciting, but not bad, either, to be here. The End.</p>
