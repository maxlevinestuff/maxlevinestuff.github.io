			<p>You spent the most time in your parents' house. Maybe you moved away at some point, but this house always remained the centerpiece of what you called home. Its walls and rooms are imprinted into your consciousness.</p>

			<p>Now, it is mostly empty, most furnishings being unnecessary.</p>

			<p>Ghosts don't have to do much in the way of bodily mantainance, however they still need to brush their "teeth." What kind of toothpaste flavor will you try today?</p>
