Hello, my name is Maximilian Levine. Welcome to my website.

I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science in the AI, Robotics, and Gaming Concentration at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

I am a recent graduate of the University of North Carolina at Asheville, with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics, as well as a Bachelor of Arts in New Media.

On this website, you will find a portfolio of some of my projects: games I have made and videos I have produced. There is also a blog where I will share related updates on my projects.

I wanted to make a portfolio of all of the games that I have created. Previously, I have uploaded my games to itch.io, but I wanted to have a website of my own. My games on itch.io can be accessed at maximilian.itch.io, and this is where I based and got a lot of my content from. The grid layout that has all the games, as well as each game page, which has a description, screenshots, download links, and, if the game is playable on the web, an iframe with the game, is all based on how itch works. I implemented this on my own site using bootstrap, which helped with the layout a lot. My new website is hosted at maxlevinestuff.github.io. I am now be more confident at pointing people to this custom-made website, rather than the itch.io one. All of the web playable games can be played on the web, through iframes. The games are the main part of the website, but I also have a section for videos. There is also a section that has a place to add blog posts, which is used for providing updates about game developments. The blog points typically to the 1st page, which makes it go back in time, unfortunately. The bio page includes a link to my resume, LinkedIn, and GitHub.
